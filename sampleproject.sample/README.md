#A sample Python project

A sample project that exists as an aid to the 
[Python Packaging User Guide]()'s [Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing Project]().

This project dost not aim to cover best practices for Python 
project development as a whole. For example, It does not 
provide guidance or tool recommedations for version control, documenting, or testing.

[The source for this project is available here]().

Most of the configuration for a Python project is done in the
**setup.py** file, an example of which is included in this project
You should edit this file accordingly to adapt this sample project
to your needs.

*************

This is the README file for the project.

The file should use UTF-8 encoding and can be written using StructuredText
or markdown with the appropriate [key set](). It will be used to generate the
project webpage on PyPI and will be displayed as the project homepage on 
common code-hosting services, and should be written for that purpose.

Typical contents for this file would indlude an overview of the project,
basic usage examples, etc. Generally, inlcuding the project changelog in
here is not a good idea, although a simple 'What's New' section for the 
most recent version maybe appropriate.
